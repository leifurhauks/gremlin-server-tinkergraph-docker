Gremlin Server container running against an instance of TinkerGraph. Intended for testing
and development purposes. I am unable to support it in production environments.

Gremlin Server and TinkerGraph are part of the [Apache TinkerPop](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/)
project.

This docker image is not maintained or endorsed by Apache TinkerPop. 

To build the image, you need to download `apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-server-3.2.4-bin.zip` and place
it in the repository root.
